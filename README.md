# pythonStockEvaluation
I use Python retrieving Taiwan stock information, computing MA18, MA50 and KD values in order to predict tendency.

The most important feature of this project is that I draw the lowset index of one stock company to assist investors understand certain stocks
are very likely to go up.

TODO:
1. Fetch news and comments from forums
2. Use jieba and text recognition to compute sentiments of news and comments
